//! Garbage collection for the persistent backend.
//!
//! GC identifies and tears down tasks that have no reverse references using the `parent_count` and
//! `transient_ref_count`. Tasks are marked `deleted` and then have their outgoing edges teared down
//! recursively.
//!
//! A collected task also has its cell data released immediately to deliver immediate memory wins.
//!
//! The pass runs under the coordinator's GC phase (see
//! [`SnapshotCoordinator::begin_gc`](crate::backend::snapshot_coordinator)), which excludes normal
//! operations. That exclusion is what lets a pass edit the graph without racing a mutation that
//! could resurrect a task mid-collect, and hand its decisions straight to persistence.
//!
//! A pass has two phases: a fully parallel, unbounded job pool that tears down garbage, followed by
//! a single scan that classifies GC roots once the graph is quiescent (see
//! [`TurboTasksBackend::gc_collect`]).
